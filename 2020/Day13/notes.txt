We have a list of tuples (p_0, x_0) to (p_N, x_N).

We want to find the first positive integer t such that the following condition is satisfied for all n:

(t + p_n) mod x_n = 0

this can be re-arranged as

(t + p_n) = k_n * x_n

for some positive integer k_n

Summing for all n:

Nt + (SUM p0 to pN) = (SUM 0 to N: k_n * x_n)

t = ((SUM 0 to N: k_n * x_n) - (SUM p0 to pN)) / N

We want to find the smallest possible t.
We know that ((SUM 0 to N: k_n * x_n) - (SUM 0 to N: k_n * x_n)) must be a multiple of N.

Let s := (SUM p0 to pN),
then

(SUM 0 to N: k_n * x_n) = Nt + s

We can iterate through possible values for all k_n until we find a valid combination.
We need to ensure we iterate through them in ascending order, so assume without loss of generality that the x_n are in ascending order.

Then iterate k_0 from 0 to x_1, and then increment x_1 and reset x_0.
Continue until x_1 reaches x_2, then start incrementing x_2 and reset x_1, and so on.
